# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
Power Bi Dashboard

📊 Just launched my latest Power BI project: “HR Analytics Dashboard” 💼
A deep dive into employee attrition, workforce demographics, and key HR metrics — all in one interactive dashboard!

🔧 Steps I followed:

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation:
Removed duplicate rows
Changed incorrect data types
Dropped unnecessary columns
📥 Imported Clean Data into Power BI

Built KPI Cards for:
👥 Total Employees
🚪 Total Attrition
📉 Attrition Rate
🎂 Average Age
💰 Average Salary
⏳ Average Years at Company

📈 Visualizations Created:
🍩 Donut Chart – Attrition by Education
(Used a conditional column to accurately calculate Attrition Count)
📊 Stacked Column Chart – Attrition by Age
💸 Stacked Bar Chart – Attrition by Salary Slab
🧑‍💼 Stacked Bar Chart – Attrition by Job Role
🌄 Area Chart – Attrition by Years at Company
📋 Matrix Table – Job Role vs. Job Satisfaction & Total Attrition
🌳 Tree Map – Gender-based insights (Male vs. Female)
🧭 Slicer – Department-wise filtering for focused analysis

🔍 Key Findings from the Dashboard:
Identified which age groups are more likely to leave the organization
Discovered that lower salary brackets have a higher attrition rate
Analyzed job satisfaction levels across roles to understand why employees are leaving

🎯 Objective:
To help HR teams and stakeholders gain actionable insights from attrition patterns, enabling smarter, data-driven decisions that support employee retention and workplace satisfaction.
